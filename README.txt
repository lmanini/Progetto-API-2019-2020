edU is basically ed but with unlimited (or as many as your memory will allow) undos or redos. edU accepts 6 commands, in the following format with no paranthesis:

1. (ind1,ind2)c : creates or modifies the rows between given indexes
2. (ind1,ind2)d : deletes rows between given indexes
3. (ind1,ind2)p : prints rows between given indexes
4. (num)u : executes num ammount of undos
5. (num)r : executes num ammount of redos
6. q : terminates edU execution

edU was written by Lucas J. Manini as a project for Politecnico di Milano's course "Progetto di Algoritmi e Principi dell'Informatica" in academic year 2019/2020.
